                    <h4>The Persistence of Memory-Salvador Dalí (1931)</h4>
                    <p>The persistence of memory addresses the notion of temporality and memory. It does so through a particular plastic language that exalts objects loaded with great symbolism, such as melting clocks, ants that walk on a firm clock that hides the mark of time, the painter's self-portrait, and the landscape.</p>

                    <p>Hokusai created a scene in which to frame Mount Fuji. The large waves, about to crush the fishermen in their boats clinging to their oars, appear larger than the mountain. Hokusai may have wished to depict a fear of and respect for the ocean with this play on perspective.</p>

                    <p>The apple being an apparent distortion of that recognition that creates a level of frustration and conflict for the viewer. There is almost a desire to knock the apple away to see who it is that is peering out over the top. This frustration draws us to look for other clues in the painting leading us to the half wall, the sea, and the clouds. </p>
